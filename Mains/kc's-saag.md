# KC's Saag

## Info
* Serves: 4-6 with rice
* Time: 25-35m active, assuming you work on things simultaneously while the paneer fries/onions brown


## Ingredients
* ~1lb mature spinach (that's the large spinach leaves, not baby spinach)
* ~8oz mustard greens, leaves removed from tough stems
* (Mostly just looking for a 2:1 ratio of spinach to mustard greens here, I never measure the weight) 
* Ghee (or neutral oil)
* Mustard oil (optional)
* 1 large onion, diced 
* 3-4 cloves garlic, crushed or minced
* 1-2" Ginger, minced or grated
* A spicy pepper (Serrano, jalap, Thai bird), minced
* Cumin seed
* Coriander seed
* Brown mustard seed
* 3-4 Whole green cardamom, pods crushed with heel of knife
* Turmeric
* Kashmiri chili powder
* Garam masala
* Paneer
* Heavy cream


## Steps
* Fry or bake paneer. Cut paneer into 3/4" cubes and fry in 1tbsp ghee or a neutral oil until brown on most sides. Alternatively, coat paneer in a thin layer of oil and bake at 400f until brown. This results in a slightly tougher paneer but is far less work. Optional: soak your paneer in water for 15 minutes before frying to make it softer
* While the paneer fries or bakes, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add all the spinach and mustard green leaves to the pot. Boil until bright green (2-3m). Transfer the leaves with any water still clinging to them to the jar of a blender. 
* Dump out the water and wipe out the pot. Turn heat to high/medium high. Add some ghee and 1-2tbsp mustard oil to the pan. When it's hot, add maybe 1tbsp cumin seeds, and slightly less coriander and mustard seeds to the pan. They will sputter and pop. Stir. 
* After 30s or so, add onion and a big pinch of salt. Sometimes I'll add baking soda here to speed up the onion browning, but it's not necessary. Cook the onion until it's deep brown. Manage the heat and add water and scrape the pan if it threatens to burn.
* When the onion mixture is deep brown, add the garlic, ginger, and pepper. Saute until fragrant, 1m or so
* Add ~2tsp turmeric, ~2tsp garam masala, ~1.5tsp kashmiri chili, the cracked cardamom pods, stir until fragrant, and cut the heat. Transfer 2/3 of this onion mixture to the blender with the spinach.
* Blend the spinach mixture until desired smoothness. I like mine pretty smooth.
* Turn heat back on to medium on the pot with the remaining onion mixture. Add the blended spinach mixture and scrape the bottom of the pan to get up any stuck bits. Stir in 1/4c-1/3c of cream. Add the fried paneer to the mixture. You can also sprinkle in some dried methi leaves here if desired. Sometimes I add a can of chickpeas here too to stretch this into more food! Adjust the consistency with water.
* Serve with your preferred starch. Basmati, roti, naan.
